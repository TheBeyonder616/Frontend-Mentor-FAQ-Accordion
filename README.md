## My Process

I developed an interactive FAQ accordion component that allows users to expand and collapse answers to frequently asked questions. The component features a clean design with smooth transitions and responsive layout.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Used modern HTML elements for structuring the FAQ component, enhancing readability and accessibility.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Leveraged CSS variables for consistent styling and easy theming.
- **Flexbox:** Applied for layout and alignment, ensuring a responsive design across different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilized `clamp()` for fluid typography and media queries for adapting the layout to various devices.
- **JavaScript:** Managed user interactions and dynamic updates, including toggling FAQ answers and updating icons.

### What I Learned

This project improved my skills in:

- **CSS Transitions:** Implementing smooth animations for expanding and collapsing FAQ answers.
- **Responsive Design:** Applying CSS techniques to create adaptable layouts for different devices.
- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Managing user interactions and dynamic changes effectively.
- **Best Practices:** Structuring code for maintainability and performance.

### Continued Development

Future enhancements will focus on:

- **Advanced JavaScript Features:** Adding more interactive elements and refining data handling techniques.
- **CSS Animations:** Experimenting with advanced CSS animations for more engaging user experiences.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Ensuring the component is fully accessible to users with various needs and preferences.
